## Contributors wanted

Please feel free to get involved in making this better. Pull requests, issues and discussions are all welcome.

## Technology

CoronaViewer was written in [React](https://reactjs.org/), bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The project is currently frontend only, with no backend code (and currently no need for any).

## Installation

These instructions use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), but you can use NPM as well.

Install frontend dependencies with:

```yarn```

## Development mode

In the project directory, you can run:

```yarn start```

This runs the app in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Build project

```yarn build```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
